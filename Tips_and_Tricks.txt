*Change execution order - Edit, Project Settings, Script Execution Order*
*Prefabs -> Collection of GameObjects and Components that are reusable throughout the game*
	How to make a prefab
	1. Create a duplicate of the game object
	2. Drag the duplicate into a "Prefabs" folder (should turn blue in the hierarchy)
	3. Whatever changes are made to the prefab in the folder, the same changes are made to the instances of that prefab
	To make similar prefabs
	1. Duplicate the prefab that you want to change
	2. Make changes to the duplicated prefab

Snap to grid -> Edit, Snap Settings, Edit how much you want the objects to move on the axis, then select all objects
****Hold command and move to snap to grid*****

-A Rigidbody allows the game object to have physics attributes
	*Usually includes Physics Materials
	*Physics Materials includes friction and bounce
	Types:
		-Static -> doesn’t move
		-Kinematic -> doesn’t move unless you tell it to move (ie. controls)
		-Dynamic -> follows physics scenarios

-Always a game object & script pair -> a script has to be a part of a game object
	*ex. MusicPlayer - empty game object with a music script (can use DontDestroyOnLoad)
	*ex. LevelManager - empty game object with a script that manages changes in scenes

-Camera "size" is half the height
