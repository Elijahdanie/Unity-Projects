*Change execution order - Edit, Project Settings, Script Execution Order*
*Prefabs -> Collection of GameObjects and Components that are reusable throughout the game*

3D Graphics - Attach a Texture to a Material, attach a Material to a 3D Object (primitive and placeholder object)

	How to make a prefab
	-Drag object into the prefab folder
	3. Whatever changes are made to the prefab in the folder, the same changes are made to the instances of that prefab
	To make similar prefabs
	1. Duplicate the prefab that you want to change
	2. Make changes to the duplicated prefab

Find a game object through script -> GameObject.FindObjectOfType<TypeOfGameObject>();

Change sprites on collision: Make a Sprite[] array, store sprites (such as broken blocks) into that array, and run through the sprite sheet (can animate like this too)

Snap to grid -> Edit, Snap Settings, Edit one unit size on the grid, then select all objects
****Hold command and move to snap to grid*****

-A Rigidbody allows the game object to have physics attributes
	*Usually includes Physics Materials
	*Physics Materials includes friction and bounce
	Types:
		-Static -> doesn’t move
		-Kinematic -> doesn’t move unless you tell it to move (ie. controls)
		-Dynamic -> follows physics scenarios

-Always a game object & script pair -> a script has to be a part of a game object
	*ex. MusicPlayer - empty game object with a music script (can use DontDestroyOnLoad)
	*ex. LevelManager - empty game object with a script that manages changes in scenes

-Camera "size" is half the height
