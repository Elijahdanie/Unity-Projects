What happens in a nutshell -> Connection Order:
     Name Server (checks AppID and which region the client wants to use)
     Master Server -> has multiple regional servers
     Game Server -> when a game room is created

A lobby lists available rooms

For a Prefab to be instantiated over a network, it has to be in the "Resources" folder

Player for Networking:
	-needs a PhotonView Component
	-for the PhotonView to synchronize, add a PhotonTransformView Component
	****ANYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE SYNCHRONIZED, ADD TO PHOTONVIEW COMPONENT****
	-check synchronize "â€¦" to whatever needs to be synchronized over the network
	PhotonTransformView
		-interpolate options -> lerp (higher speed, faster)
	
	EVERYTHING FOLLOWS photonView.isMine sequence -> if only local player, then allow input, camera, sprites from input, animations, etc.
